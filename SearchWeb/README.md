# Search Web
A VSCode extension that adds a *Search Web* option to your context menu! 

All you have to do is highlight some text, right-click to open the context menu, then select *Search Web* (probably at the bottom of your menu). Most likely you'll be warned about travelling outside of VSCode's purview; thus, requiring your permission to navigate to the link.

## Search Engine
Currenlty, the search engine is not configurable. It's using Google.
